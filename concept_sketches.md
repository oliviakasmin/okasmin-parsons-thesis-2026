#### Sketch 1 - clustered vessels arranged on x-y plane
This visualization aims to show the most common vessel shapes and highlight patterns.
Possible filters include showing the place of origin, the date, the actual surface treatment, and the function of the vessel.

#### Sketch 2 - individual vessel clusters displayed by geography and date
This visualization introduces some cultural/ historical context and shows the potentially large diversity in place and date across the clusters (despite the commonalities of the shapes). 
Only one vessel cluster will be shown at a time, and date related information (such as progressions in technology) will be included on the timeline view.
This may also be a good time to also include some relevant cultural commentary.

#### Sketch 3 - outlier vessel shapes displayed by date
This visualization celebrates the unique shapes that don't easily fit into clusters.
